It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

Now, the first step is converting the PDF to an image. So for this example, I use the reinforcement learning lecture notes from David Silver. First, we're going to use the PDF to image package from Python to convert the PDF slides to images. Now that I have a bunch of slide images like these, I'm going to detect and recognize the text in the images. For that, I'm going to use the OCR.pyTarch repo, which you can check out here, to run text detection on the slide images. Now these are some example outputs, and now we can produce the text outputs. So you might think it's overq, and you might be right, but I don't like PDF to text packages in Python, so I use this approach. The next step would be to use some fancy language models to process and summarize the text, but let's leave that for another video. If you want to check out the detail article, link is in my bio, and follow for more. Cheers.\n"
